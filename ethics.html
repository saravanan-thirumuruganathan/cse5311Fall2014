<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>STATEMENT ON ETHICS, 
PROFESSIONALISM, AND CONDUCT</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial">COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial">THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS 
AT ARLINGTON</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The College cannot and will not tolerate 
any form of academic dishonesty by its students.  This includes, 
but is not limited to cheating on examinations, plagiarism, or collusion 
(explained below).</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Cheating</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> 
on an examination includes:</font></p>

<ul><p><font size="2" face="Arial">1. Copying from another&#39;s paper, any 
means of communication with another during an examination, giving aid 
to or receiving aid from another during an examination;</font></p></ul>
<ul><p><font size="2" face="Arial">2. Using any material during an examination 
that is unauthorized by the proctor;</font></p></ul>
<ul><p><font size="2" face="Arial">3. Taking or attempting to take an 
examination for another student or allowing another student to take 
or attempt to take an examination for oneself.</font></p></ul>
<ul><p><font size="2" face="Arial">4. Using, obtaining, or attempting 
to obtain by any means the whole or any part of a not-yet-administered 
examination.</font></p></ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Plagiarism</b> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">is 
the unacknowledged incorporation of another&#39;s work into work which the 
student offers for credit.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Collusion</b> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">is 
the unauthorized collaboration of another in preparing work that a student 
offers for credit.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Student Responsibility Regarding Academic 
Dishonesty</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Students who choose to take the risk 
associated with scholastic dishonesty and any other violation of the 
Code of Student Conduct and Discipline must assume responsibility for 
their behavior and accept the consequences. These consequences are described 
on the back of this statement and elsewhere including UTA policies and 
class syllabi.  In an academic community, the standards for integrity 
are high. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Students who are aware of scholastic 
dishonesty and any other academic policy or conduct violations, have 
the responsibility to report academic policy violations to their professor, 
to a College of Engineering administrator, or to the Office of Student 
Judicial Affairs. The decision to do so is one of many moral dilemmas 
to be faced as students define who they are. [paraphrased from the Office 
of Student Judicial Affairs website<sup>1</sup>] </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">One method of reporting an academic policy 
violation is to submit a narrative of the incident to the Office of 
Student Judicial Affairs, located in E.H. Hereford University Center, 
lower level, B160, Box 19355 or to the professor. This narrative can 
also be submitted via email at <a href="mailto:judicial@uta.edu" target="_blank">judicial@uta.edu</a> or faxed to (817) 272-5221</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">.</font>
