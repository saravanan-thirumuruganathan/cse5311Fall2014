% Fancy headers and footers.

% March, 1989.

% Here is a documentstylestyle option that allows you to customize your
% page headers and footers in an easy way. It combines features that were
% separately available in other pagestyles, without introducing much
% complexity. You can define:
%     - three-part headers and footers
%     - rules in header and footer
%     - headers and footers wider than \textwidth
%     - multiline headers and footers
%     - separate headers and footers for even and odd pages
%     - separate headers and footers for chapter pages
% 
% To use this pagestyle, you must include the ``fancyheadings'' style
% option in your \documentstyle, and issue the \pagestyle{fancy} command.
% The \pagestyle{fancy} command should be issued after any changes made to
% \textwidth.
% 
% The page layout will be as follows:
% 
%               LHEAD          CHEAD          RHEAD
%               ----------------------------------- (rule)
% 
%                            page body
% 
% 
%               ----------------------------------- (rule)
%               LFOOT          CFOOT          RFOOT
% 
% The L-fields will be leftadjusted, the C-fields centered and the
% R-fields rightadjusted.
% Each of the six fields and the two rules can be defined separately.
% 
% Simple use:
% 
% The header and footer fields can be defined by commands \lhead{LHEAD}
% and so on for the other fields. If the field depends on something in the
% document (e.g. section titles) you must in general use the \markboth and
% \markright commands, otherwise a title may end on the wrong page. You
% can do this e.g. by redefining the commands \chaptermark, \sectionmark
% and so on (see example below). The defaults for these marks are as in
% the standard pagestyles. The marks can be put into a header or footer
% field by referencing \leftmark and \rightmark.
% 
% Rules in header and footer
% 
% The thickness of the rules below the header and above the footer can be
% changed by redefining the length parameters \headrulewidth (default
% 0.4pt) and \footrulewidth (default 0). These may be redefined by the
% \setlength command. A thickness of 0pt makes the rule invisible.
% If you want to make more complicated changes, you have to redefine the
% commands \headrule and/or \footrule.
% 
% Headers and footers wider than \textwidth
% 
% The headers and footers are set in a box of width \headwidth. The
% default for this is the value of \textwidth. You can make it wider (or
% smaller) by redefining \headwidth with the \setlength or \addtolength
% command. The headers and footers will stick out the page on the same
% side as the marginal notes. For example to include the marginal notes,
% add both \marginparsep and \marginparwidth to \headwidth (see also the
% example below).
% 
% Multiline headers and footers
% 
% Each of the six fields is set in an appropriate parbox, so you can put a
% multiline part in it with the \\ command. It is also possible to put
% extra space in it with the \vspace command. Note that if you do this you
% will probably have to increase the \headheight or \footskip lengths.
% 
% Separate headers and footers for even and odd pages
% 
% If you want the headers and footers to be different on even- and
% odd-numbered pages in the ``twoside'' style, the field-defining macros
% can be given an optional argument, to be used on the even-numbered
% pages, like \lhead[EVEN-LHEAD]{ODD-RHEAD}.
% 
% Separate headers and footers for chapter pages
% 
% LaTeX gives a \thispagestyle{plain} command for the first page of the
% document, the first page of each chapter and a couple of other pages. It
% might be incompatible with your pagestyle. In this case you can use a
% slightly different version of the pagestyle, called \pagestyle{fancyplain}. 
% This pagestyle redefines the pagestyle ``plain'' to also use pagestyle
% ``fancy'' with the following modifications:
%     - the thicknesses of the rules is defined by \plainheadrulewidth and
%       \plainfootrulewidth (both default 0).
%     - the 6 fields may be defined separately for the plain pages by
%       giving them the value \fancyplain{PLAIN-VALUE}{NORMAL-VALUE}. This
%       construct may be used in both the optional argument and the normal
%       argument. Thus \lhead[\fancyplain{F1}{F2}]{\fancyplain{F3}{F4}}
%       specifies the LHEAD value in a two-sided document:
%       F1 on an even-numbered ``plain'' page
%       F2 on an even-numbered normal page
%       F3 on an odd-numbered ``plain'' page
%       F4 on an odd-numbered normal page.
% 
% Defaults:
% 
% \headrulewidth              0.4pt
% \footrulewidth                0pt
% \plainheadrulewidth   0pt
% \plainfootrulewidth   0pt
% 
% \lhead[\fancyplain{}{\sl\rightmark}]{\fancyplain{}{\sl\leftmark}}
% %  i.e. empty on ``plain'' pages \rightmark on even, \leftmark on odd pages
% \chead{}
% \rhead[\fancyplain{}{\sl\leftmark}]{\fancyplain{}{\sl\rightmark}}
% %  i.e. empty on ``plain'' pages \leftmark on even, \rightmark on odd pages
% \lfoot{}
% \cfoot{\rm\thepage} % page number
% \rfoot{}
% 
% Examples:
% 
% To put two lines containing the section title and the subsection title
% in the righthandside corner, use:
% 
% \documentstyle[fancyheadings]{article}
% \pagestyle{fancy}
% \renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markboth{#1}{}}
% \renewcommand{\subsectionmark}[1]{\markright{#1}}
% \rfoot{\leftmark\\\rightmark}
% 
% The following definitions give an approximation of the style used in the
% LaTeX book:
% 
% \documentstyle[fancyheadings]{book}
% \pagestyle{fancyplain}
% \addtolength{\headwidth}{\marginparsep}
% \addtolength{\headwidth}{\marginparwidth}
% \renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{\markboth{#1}{#1}} % remember chapter title
% \renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesection\ #1}}
%                                                 % section number and title
% \lhead[\fancyplain{}{\bf\thepage}]{\fancyplain{}{\bf\rightmark}}
% \rhead[\fancyplain{}{\bf\leftmark}]{\fancyplain{}{\bf\thepage}}
